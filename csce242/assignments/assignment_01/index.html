    <p>
        Small but spirited, low-lying but loud-- the Carolina Wren is one of many species of 
        songbirds that can be found on USC's campus. More often heard than seen, these wrens 
        can pack quite the personality. They are very vocal when passed by people, and paired 
        with their strong white eyebrows, they have the appearance of always looking 
        angry or serious. 

        Perhaps one of the most recognizable bird noises belongs to the Carolina Wren male, 
        who sings a sharp, rolling song that is extremely variable and been transcribed in 
        several ways. In addition to their feisty personality, Carolina Wrens are extremely 
        versatile in their nesting locations. Have an empty outdoor pot, shoe, or space in 
        your garage? They might try and nest there.
